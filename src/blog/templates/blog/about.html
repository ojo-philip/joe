      <p>Nowadays, the media is being used to fulfill every other agenda apart from the agenda of God. Satan is, of course relentless in his plan to bring at least a filthy content to our faces every day, especially to the Christian so that it becomes a seed of corruption which grows to a mighty tree in the heart.</p>
      <p>Jesus Over Everything is a global community that stands as part of the army of Christ in media. We intend to join the rest of Jesus' soldiers to fill this space with godly content that reveals more of Jesus to you.</p>
      <p>This is a meeting point between you and Jesus.</p>
      <p>You will know Him more before leaving.</p>
      <p>You are welcome</p>
